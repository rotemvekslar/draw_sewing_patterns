# Draw Sewing Patterns Project
    The following code allows the creation of a sewing pattern
    by the measurements saved in the file or
    by the measurements received during runing.

# Running the code
    At the beginning, the user enters the
    name of the current pattern and the desired pattern type.

    After that, he\she will be asked if the size is known to him\her
    (that means the size is stored in a csv file according to the format
    see example csv files).

	    If the size is saved,
        load the file and you will get your pattern.

	    If the size is not saved,
        follow the instructions asking the user to measure
        the necessary measurements for drawing the pattern.
        After filling all the size measurements you will get your pattern.
